# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This interactive workshop will introduce data visualization in Python for researchers with little or no previous programming experience. A gentle introduction to Python will be followed by an introduction to best practices in data visualization. Those techniques will then be applied to the visualization of a real-world dataset. By the end of the workshop participants should be able to ingest a new data source using Python, and produce a series of visualizations of that data. This workshop is domain agnostic and is open to researchers from the sciences, social sciences, or humanities."
